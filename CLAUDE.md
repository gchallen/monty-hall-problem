# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is for implementing the Monty Hall problem simulation. The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario where:
1. A contestant chooses one of three doors
2. Behind one door is a prize (car), behind the other two are goats
3. The host opens one of the non-chosen doors revealing a goat
4. The contestant can then switch their choice or stick with their original door

## Development Guidelines

Since this is a new project, consider implementing:
- A simulation function that runs multiple iterations of the game
- Functions for both "switch" and "stay" strategies
- Statistical analysis to demonstrate the probability outcomes
- Clear documentation of the mathematical reasoning

## Common Commands

As the project develops, update this section with:
- Build/run commands for the chosen language
- Test commands if tests are implemented
- Any linting or formatting commands used

## Git Workflow

- Commit incrementally to Git with descriptive commit messages
